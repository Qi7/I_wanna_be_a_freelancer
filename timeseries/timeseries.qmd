## Demo data

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the AirPassengers dataset
data("AirPassengers")
head(AirPassengers, 60)
```


## Perform STL decomposition
```{r}
stl_decomp <- stl(AirPassengers, s.window = "periodic")

# Plot the decomposition
plot(stl_decomp)
```

## Fit an ARIMA model to the decomposed data
```{r}
fit <- auto.arima(AirPassengers)

# Print the summary of the ARIMA model
summary(fit)

# Forecast the next 24 months (2 years)
forecasted <- forecast(fit, h = 24)

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecasted)
```
